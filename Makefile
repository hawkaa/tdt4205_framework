# For all the handwritten C files, there is a C file in 'src' and a matching
# header file in 'include', object code should be rebuilt every time there is
# a change in one or both.
# The dependency of src/*.o on src/*.c is implicit, dependency on the header
# file is included here.
# The code is built in 'src', and moved to 'obj' afterwards to keep the file
# tree tidy.

# created as a side-effect of creating the parser...
